Web scraping from UCL machine learning website
The JSON file only contains one of the data, feel free to fork and make changes to get all the data.
Alot of bad practices, it'll get better with time.

UCL website noted to be done for a while. Using a HTML file I scrapped earlier when I started the project.
Incase the website comes back on, tweak the "url" variable and also ignore the plenty comments, shows my manual debugging lol.
I also fixed the issue of trailing space showing as byte character. No trailing spaces, The "strip" method is quite useful.
